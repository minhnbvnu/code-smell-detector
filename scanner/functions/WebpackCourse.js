          Why do you need both a <code>.babelrc</code> file <i>and</i> a
          <code> webpack.config.js</code> file? What's the difference between
          babel and webpack?
        </p>

        <p>
          And why should you put CSS and images in the bundle? Isn't the bundle
          supposed to be a JavaScript file?
        </p>
