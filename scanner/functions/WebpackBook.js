          <h3>Setting up an app with webpack shouldn't be this complex</h3>
          <p style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>
            The heart of webpack — the <code>webpack.config.js</code> — has a
            syntax that probably makes sense for hackers on the internals of
            webpack. But for devs just wanting to create a new project, it's a
            nightmare to write.
          </p>
          <Image alt="webpack config wtf" src={webpackConfigImg} />
          <p style={{ marginTop: 0 }}>
            You see keywords like <code>module</code>, <code>rules</code>,{' '}
            <code>use</code>, <code>entry</code>, <code>plugins</code>. But what
            does that all even mean in the context of a build setup for a web
            app?
          </p>
          <p>
            You stumble around with webpack, browsing the docs, tutorials,
            blogs, YouTube and Stack Overflow to try to make sense of it all.
            And you're really struggling.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>
              The problem is that every tutorial has its own creative way of
              configuring webpack.
            </i>
          </p>
          <p>
            One tutorial tells you to use the <code>html-webpack-plugin</code>{' '}
            (whatever that is?) and another tutorial doesn't mention that at
            all.
          </p>
          <p>
            One tutorial uses <code>babel-preset-env</code> and another uses
            something else.
          </p>
          <p>
            There just doesn't seem to be one standard way of implementing
            anything with webpack. This makes it very difficult to know what is
            the best practice way to configure it.
          </p>
          <p>
            You know that webpack is a really powerful tool, it's just so time
            consuming to figure out how it works.
          </p>
          <h3>
            When you know webpack on a deeper level a new world in frontend
            ecosystem opens up for you:
          </h3>
          <p>
            <b>
              ➡️ You'll know how create-react-app, Gatsby, Next.js, etc work

          </p>
          <p>
            Make sense of the ejected create-react-app webpack config. Know how
            to extend it and adjust it to your needs. Extend Gatsby in
            gatby-node.js with ease.

            <b>

          </p>
          <p>
            And in those cases when you get stuck, you know what to google for
            and interpret the result. You are able to not only read and
            understand the webpack docs but you'll enjoy it.

            Stand out from other devs on the team and be the go-to guy when it
            comes to setting up new frontend apps. Raise your overall knowledge

          <h3>Learn webpack from the ground up with "Learn webpack ebook"</h3>
          <p>
            Learn webpack is an e-book designed to make the process of learning
            webpack as quick and smooth as possible for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            To <i>deeply</i> learn webpack, you’ll start with a clean slate. No
            more copy-pasting boilerplates and ejecting CRA to try to figure out
            things backward. You’ll start with an empty editor and you'll write
            the whole <code>webpack.config.js</code> yourself.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will learn step-by-step how to build the{' '}
            <code>webpack.config.js</code>, <code>package.json</code>,{' '}
            <code>.babelrc</code> and all other files required to build a modern
            web app with webpack. This approach makes webpack super easy to
            learn.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it’s not enough just to learn the syntax. You’ll learn all about
            the dependencies like Babel, webpack-dev-server, and React hot
            loader. You learn what they do and why you need them. This way you
            can use the dependencies to your advantage, to make your app fast
            and beautiful for your users.
          </p>
          <p>
            You’ll also learn how to squeeze out every juice of webpack to make
            your app as fast as possible by using advanced techniques such as
            code splitting and tree shaking.
          </p>

          <p>The book is made up of three parts:</p>
          <p>
            <b>Part 1: The Getting started tutorial </b>
            You'll jump straight into coding your first React app with webpack.
            You start from scratch and you will finish up with a complete
            webpack project that you can put in production. This tutorial is
            designed to get you up and running quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Part 2: Production-ready apps with webpack </b>
            You’ll learn how to configure an awesome developer experience that
            makes you super productive <i>and</i> use tools and techniques to
            get the lowest possible bundle size for the production build. You’ll
            also learn about the internals of webpack. Loaders, plugins,
            manifests and chunks will no longer feel like magic
          </p>
          <p>
            <b> Part 3: Recipes</b> Even the webpack pros have to look up how to
            configure specific things like Vue, React, Typescript, etc. In this
            part of the book, you will have recipes that you can use to create
            the app you want to create - so you don't have read long and
            outdated medium-articles to get the code you need.
