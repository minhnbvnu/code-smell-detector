  // Batching is necessary here in order to ensure that all event handlers run
  // before the next rerender (including event handlers attached to ancestor
  // elements instead of directly on the input). Without this, controlled
  // components don't work properly in conjunction with event bubbling because
  // the component is rerendered and the value reverted before all the event
  // handlers can run. See https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/708.
