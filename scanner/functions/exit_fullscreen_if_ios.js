			// (:fullscreen and document.fullscreenElement stops working because it's not "requested by the page" anymore)
			// (the fullscreen styling is not generally obtrusive, but it is obtrusive when it DOESN'T work)
			//
			// alternatives:
			// - detect reload-while-fullscreen by storing a timestamp on unload when fullscreen,
			//   and apply the fullscreen class if timestamp is within a few seconds during load.
			//   - This doesn't have an answer for detecting leaving fullscreen,
			//     and if it keeps thinking it's fullscreen, it'll keep storing the timestamp, and get stuck.
			//     Unless it only stores the timestamp if it knows it's fullscreen? (i.e. page-requested fullscreen)
			//     Then it would only work for one reload.
			//     So ideally it would have the below anyway, in which case this would be unnecessary.
			// - detect fullscreen state without fullscreen API, using viewport size
			//   - If this is possible, why don't browsers just expose this information in the fullscreen API? :(
			//   - iPad resets the zoom level when going fullscreen, and then when reloading,
			//     the zoom level is reset to the user-set zoom level.
			//     Safari doesn't update devicePixelRatio based on the zoom level,
			//     and doesn't support ResizeObserver for device pixels.
			//     It does support https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Visual_Viewport_API
			//     though, so maybe something can be done with that.
