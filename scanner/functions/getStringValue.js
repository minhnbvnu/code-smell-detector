function getStringValue(name) {
  // Property names must be strings. This means that non-string objects cannot be used
  // as keys in an object. Any non-string object, including a number, is typecasted
  // into a string via the toString method.
  // -- MDN, https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_accessors#Property_names
  //
  // So, to ensure that we are checking the same `name` that JavaScript would use, we cast it
  // to a string. It's not always possible. If `name` is an object and its `toString` method is
  // 'broken' (doesn't return a string, isn't a function, etc.), an error will be thrown:
  //
  // TypeError: Cannot convert object to primitive value
  //
  // For performance reasons, we don't catch this error here and allow it to propagate up the call
  // stack. Note that you'll get the same error in JavaScript if you try to access a property using
  // such a 'broken' object as a key.
