  // I am not an expert on the topic, and I don't want to write a thesis.
  // However, it is good to outline here the basic algorithm and the few data
  // structures and optimizations here that make this implementation fast.
  // The basic idea behind LZW is to build a table of previously seen runs
  // addressed by a short id (herein called output code).  All data is
  // referenced by a code, which represents one or more values from the
  // original input stream.  All input bytes can be referenced as the same
  // value as an output code.  So if you didn't want any compression, you
  // could more or less just output the original bytes as codes (there are
  // some details to this, but it is the idea).  In order to achieve
  // compression, values greater then the input range (codes can be up to
  // 12-bit while input only 8-bit) represent a sequence of previously seen
  // inputs.  The decompressor is able to build the same mapping while
  // decoding, so there is always a shared common knowledge between the
  // encoding and decoder, which is also important for "timing" aspects like
  // how to handle variable bit width code encoding.
  //
  // One obvious but very important consequence of the table system is there
  // is always a unique id (at most 12-bits) to map the runs.  'A' might be
  // 4, then 'AA' might be 10, 'AAA' 11, 'AAAA' 12, etc.  This relationship
  // can be used for an effecient lookup strategy for the code mapping.  We
  // need to know if a run has been seen before, and be able to map that run
  // to the output code.  Since we start with known unique ids (input bytes),
  // and then from those build more unique ids (table entries), we can
  // continue this chain (almost like a linked list) to always have small
  // integer values that represent the current byte chains in the encoder.
  // This means instead of tracking the input bytes (AAAABCD) to know our
  // current state, we can track the table entry for AAAABC (it is guaranteed
  // to exist by the nature of the algorithm) and the next character D.
  // Therefor the tuple of (table_entry, byte) is guaranteed to also be
  // unique.  This allows us to create a simple lookup key for mapping input
  // sequences to codes (table indices) without having to store or search
  // any of the code sequences.  So if 'AAAA' has a table entry of 12, the
  // tuple of ('AAAA', K) for any input byte K will be unique, and can be our
  // key.  This leads to a integer value at most 20-bits, which can always
  // fit in an SMI value and be used as a fast sparse array / object key.

  // Output code for the current contents of the index buffer.
  var ib_code = index_stream[0] & code_mask;  // Load first input index.
  var code_table = { };  // Key'd on our 20-bit "tuple".

  emit_code(clear_code);  // Spec says first code should be a clear code.

  // First index already loaded, process the rest of the stream.

    // Check if we have to create a new code table entry.
    if (cur_code === undefined) {  // We don't have buffer + k.
      // Emit index buffer (without k).
      // This is an inline version of emit_code, because this is the core
      // writing routine of the compressor (and V8 cannot inline emit_code
      // because it is a closure here in a different context).  Additionally
      // we can call emit_byte_to_buffer less often, because we can have
      // 30-bits (from our 31-bit signed SMI), and we know our codes will only
      // be 12-bits, so can safely have 18-bits there without overflow.
