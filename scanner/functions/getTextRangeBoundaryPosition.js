                For the particular case of a boundary within a text node containing line breaks (within a <pre> element,
                for example), we need a slightly complicated approach to get the boundary's offset in IE. The facts:

                - Each line break is represented as \r in the text node's data/nodeValue properties
                - Each line break is represented as \r\n in the TextRange's 'text' property
                - The 'text' property of the TextRange does not contain trailing line breaks

                To get round the problem presented by the final fact above, we can use the fact that TextRange's
                moveStart() and moveEnd() methods return the actual number of characters moved, which is not necessarily
                the same as the number of characters it was instructed to move. The simplest approach is to use this to
                store the characters moved when moving both the start and end of the range to the start of the document
                body and subtracting the start offset from the end offset (the "move-negative-gazillion" method).
                However, this is extremely slow when the document is large and the range is near the end of it. Clearly
                doing the mirror image (i.e. moving the range boundaries to the end of the document) has the same
                problem.

                Another approach that works is to use moveStart() to move the start boundary of the range up to the end
                boundary one character at a time and incrementing a counter with the value returned by the moveStart()
                call. However, the check for whether the start boundary has reached the end boundary is expensive, so
                this method is slow (although unlike "move-negative-gazillion" is largely unaffected by the location of
                the range within the document).

                The method below is a hybrid of the two methods above. It uses the fact that a string containing the
                TextRange's 'text' property with each \r\n converted to a single \r character cannot be longer than the
                text of the TextRange, so the start of the range is moved that length initially and then a character at
                a time to make up for any trailing line breaks not contained in the 'text' property. This has good
                performance in most situations compared to the previous two methods.
